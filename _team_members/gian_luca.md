Gian Luca was born in Buenos Aires, grew up in Miami, and is a new resident of the Bay Area. After studying Molecular and Cellular Biology, Engineering, and Data science at Vanderbilt University, he is now a Junior Specialist in the Allen Lab exploring how synthetic biology tools can be used to better understand the immune response against cancer. He hopes to combine his passion for immunology and cancer with his curiosity for data science to uncover complex interactions in the tumor microenvironment. When not in lab, Gian enjoys spending time running, biking, swimming, and exploring the outdoor climbing scene in California.
