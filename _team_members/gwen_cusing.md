I grew up in the Bay Area and earned my B.S. in Biology from Northeastern University in 
Boston, MA in 2021. Prior to starting at UCSF, I worked at various biotech companies in the 
Boston area focused on developing immunotherapies for cancer. Most recently, I worked at 
Tango Therapeutics, a precision oncology company leveraging synthetic lethality to develop 
therapeutics for cancer. There, I designed and executed enCas12a combo CRISPR screens to 
discover gene pairs in which loss of both genes renders cancer cells sensitive to immune-
mediated killing. In 2024, I started graduate school as a part of UCSFâ€™s Biomedical Sciences 
program. Outside of lab, you can find me running or hiking, exploring coffee shops with friends, 
reading books, or doing various crafts like knitting or scrapbooking.

In co-mentorship with Dr. Julia Carnevale, I aim to integrate functional genomics and synthetic 
biology approaches to design better T cell-based therapies for solid tumors.
