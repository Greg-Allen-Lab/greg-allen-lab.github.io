Hi! I'm a UCSF graduate student in the Tetrad Program. I graduated from UCLA with a double major in molecular biology and computational biology. Then I discovered the blend of my interests in epigenetic and immunology during my time in Stanford, where I performed bulk and single-cell genomic assays to understand the epigenetic regulation of immune responses in macrophages and T cells. Now joint with Dr. Hani Goodarzi, I'm eager to explore ways to model CAR-T response in different tumor microenvironment. Outside the lab, I enjoy oil painting, snowboarding, crafting, baking, or simply hanging out with friends.
